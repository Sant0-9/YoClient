# YoClient – Java Socket Client 🔌

![Logo](yo.png)

This is a simple Java client app that connects to a server and sends a message using TCP sockets.

## 💡 Features
- Connects to a server over IP/Port
- Sends a "Yo" message
- Uses Java socket streams
- Written for class project (Spring 2025, UT Dallas)

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
javac YoClient.java
java YoClient
```

If you're using `MyYoClient.java`, do:

```bash
javac MyYoClient.java
java MyYoClient
```

You must have a server running locally (127.0.0.1) on the port specified in the code.

## 📚 What I Learned
- How client-server architecture works
- Java networking with sockets
- Terminal commands for compilation and execution
- Exception handling and I/O streams

## ⚠️ Note
This project only contains the **client-side code**. The server was part of a classroom-provided setup and is not included in this repository.

## 🙏 Credits
This was built as part of a course at UT Dallas. Starter code was provided by the professor.
